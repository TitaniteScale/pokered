## TitaniteScale's Pokemon Red Hack
## Roadmap

# Intro
This will show which order I want to work on things in. They may get their own github issue or something depending on the complexity of the change so this will just be kind of high level.

# First Pass
- Gary Recharacterization []
- Gym Leader Recharacterization []
- Location Renaming (eg Chickamauga, Asheville, Mt. Mitchell) []
- Trade Evo Changes (Changed to stones) [x]
- Moon Stone for sale in Celadon. []
- All Pokemon available in Red that are in Blue. []
- Add Dragon Claw and Dragon Breath[]
- Make Mew Available []
- Small changes here and there.

# Second Pass
- Rocket Storyline Fleshed Out []
- Harder quality of life changes (Fixing Hyper Beam and such) []
- Add Ho-Oh and Lugia []
- Add additional Dragon type moves.
- TM name display []
- Exp Bars []

#Post Release
- Surfboard []
- Regional Starter Selection []
- Starter Island []
- More legends []

# Moves to Be Added
- Safeguard []
- Ancientpower []
- Future Sight (Harder) []
- Rain Dance (We'll see tbh) []

# Fixes to Make
- Exp Share doesn't work quite right.
  - If you start with one pokemon, then switch it. It will get its bonus from fighting and then it will also share in the split exp. I don't think this is a hard fix but it is a needed one.
